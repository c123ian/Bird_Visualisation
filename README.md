Heatmap for Bird populations in Ireland

There's a haunting beauty in the songs of the birds of Ireland. However, recent studies point towards a rather bleak reality. A whopping 54 species of birds, which equates to over 26% of the studied population, now find themselves on the endangered Red list. This is a clarion call for action.

In this article, we will process and analyze this dataset, presenting our findings to highlight the importance of conserving these species.
